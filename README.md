# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM_CODSOFT
This project implements a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system suggests items to users based on their historical interactions with various items. The primary focus is on recommending movies, but the same principles can be adapted for other domains like books or products.
