# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM_CODSOFT
This project implements a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system suggests items to users based on their historical interactions with various items. The primary focus is on recommending movies, but the same principles can be adapted for other domains like books or products.
Features
User-Item Interaction Matrix: Utilizes a matrix of user-item interactions to train the recommendation model.
Collaborative Filtering: Employs the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm from the implicit library for generating recommendations.
Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using precision at k (P@k) metric.
Recommendations: Provides personalized recommendations for users based on their historical interactions.
